-- The "Data.List.Split" module contains a wide range of strategies
-- for splitting lists with respect to some sort of delimiter, mostly
-- implemented through a unified combinator interface.  The goal is to
-- be flexible yet simple.  See below for usage, examples, and
-- detailed documentation of all exported functions.  If you want to
-- learn about the implementation, see "Data.List.Split.Internals".
--
-- A git repository containing the source (including a module with
-- over 40 QuickCheck properties) can be found at
-- <https://github.com/byorgey/split>.

-- $started
-- To get started, you should take a look at the functions 'splitOn',
-- 'splitOneOf', 'splitWhen', 'endBy', 'chunksOf', 'splitPlaces',
-- and other functions listed in the next two sections.  These
-- functions implement various common splitting operations, and one of
-- them will probably do the job 90\% of the time.  For example:
--
-- >>> splitOn "x" "axbxc"
-- ["a","b","c"]
--
-- >>> splitOn "x" "axbxcx"
-- ["a","b","c",""]
--
-- >>> endBy ";" "foo;bar;baz;"
-- ["foo","bar","baz"]
--
-- >>> splitWhen (<0) [1,3,-4,5,7,-9,0,2]
-- [[1,3],[5,7],[0,2]]
--
-- >>> splitOneOf ";.," "foo,bar;baz.glurk"
-- ["foo","bar","baz","glurk"]
--
-- >>> chunksOf 3 ['a'..'z']
-- ["abc","def","ghi","jkl","mno","pqr","stu","vwx","yz"]
--
-- If you want more flexibility, however, you can use the combinator
-- library in terms of which these functions are defined.  For more
-- information, see the section labeled \"Splitting Combinators\".
--
-- The goal of this library is to be flexible yet simple.  It does not
-- implement any particularly sophisticated list-splitting methods,
-- nor is it tuned for speed.  If you find yourself wanting something
-- more complicated or optimized, it probably means you should use a
-- real parsing or regular expression library.

-- $conv
-- These functions implement some common splitting strategies.  Note
-- that all of the functions in this section drop delimiters from the
-- final output, since that is a more common use case.  If you wish to
-- keep the delimiters somehow, see the \"Splitting Combinators\"
-- section.

-- $other
-- Other useful splitting methods which are not implemented using the
-- combinator framework.

-- $comb
-- The core of the library is the 'Splitter' type, which represents a
-- particular list-splitting strategy.  All of the combinators revolve
-- around constructing or transforming 'Splitter' objects; once a
-- suitable 'Splitter' has been created, it can be run with the
-- 'split' function.  For example:
--
-- >>> split (dropBlanks . condense $ whenElt (<0)) [1,2,4,-5,-6,4,9,-19,-30]
-- [[1,2,4],[-5,-6],[4,9],[-19,-30]]

-- $basic
-- All these basic strategies have the same parameters as the
-- 'defaultSplitter' except for the delimiter.

-- $transform
-- Functions for altering splitting strategy parameters.

-- $derived
-- Combinators which can be defined in terms of other combinators, but
-- are provided for convenience.
